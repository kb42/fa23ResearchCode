The truss is supported by two supports at points A and E, which are often considered as pinned (hinged) and roller supports, respectively, in structural analysis.\n\nThe truss itself consists of interconnected members that create triangular units, which are used to distribute and support loads in a structure. The individual members are labeled with letters from A to H. The diagram indicates that there are external forces (loads) acting downwards at points B, C, and D with magnitudes of 12 kN (kilonewtons), 14 kN, and 18 kN, respectively.\n\nThe truss has a horizontal span, as shown by the dimensions between the supports A and E, with each panel or section being 3 meters apart. There is also a vertical dimension given between the top and bottom chords of the truss, which is 3 meters.\n\nThis kind of analysis is essential in civil engineering to understand how forces and moments are transmitted through a structure. The information provided in the image can be used to calculate the forces in each truss member, which is a common task in the field of statics and structural engineering.

There is an inclined plane at an angle θ to the horizontal.\n2. On the plane, there is a block (the blue box) which is probably an object being studied for its motion or static equilibrium on the slope.\n3. \"F_N\" represents the normal force, which is perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane. This force is a reaction force to the block being on the slope.\n4. \"F_N cosθ\" is the component of the normal force that acts horizontally (parallel to the ground).\n5. \"F_N sinθ\" is the component of the normal force that acts vertically (perpendicular to the ground). This component helps to balance the gravitational force.\n6. \"μ_k F_N cosθ\" indicates the force of kinetic friction, assuming that\"μ_k\" represents the coefficient of kinetic friction. This force opposes the motion of the block down the plane.\n7. \"w = mg\" is the weight of the object, where \"m\" is the mass and \"g\" is the acceleration due to gravity. This weight acts downwards, directly toward the center of the Earth.\n8. The weight vector of the object is divided into two components as well: \"w sinθ,\" which points parallel to the plane (this component contributes to making the block slide down), and \"w\""

The horizontal axis of the graph represents time measured in seconds, while the vertical axis represents the amplitude of the wave.\n\nThe graph shows that the wave completes four full cycles in one second. It's annotated to show that the frequency (f) of the wave is 4 Hertz (Hz), which means that the wave oscillates four times per second. One Hertz is defined as one cycle per second.\n\nThe points where the wave crosses the horizontal axis (time axis) are the points where the wave amplitude is zero, and the highest and lowest points of the wave represent the peak amplitudes. The distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs is one wavelength, and the time it takes to complete one full cycle is called the period of the wave.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, it is highlighted that the frequency is equal to one cycle per second (Hz = 1 cycle / 1 sec) and emphasizes that the frequency (f) for this wave is 4 Hz, which is indicated with a yellow background."
